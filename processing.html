				<h3> process: </h3><p> at first i did not know how i wanted to go about on making my own self-portrait, but i decided to make it simple, especially since i was practically teaching myself the basics of Processing at home while i was in the middle of getting over a cold. using basic tools for Processing, such as "rect" and "ellipse," and giving them color, i was able to create a small, cartoonish drawing of myself in Processing. it is not that great, but it is great for me who learned processing for the first time. </p>

				<h1> advanced: </h1>
				<h3> title: </h3><p> dots </p>
				<h3> date: </h3><p> 05/10/2018 </p>
				<h3> medium: </h3><p> .js </p>
				<h3> description: </h3><p> a "playful" and "childish reminiscent" interactive art for you, the user. almost resembling candy and it falling everywhere as you open a bag of it. </p>

				<p> instructions: move the mouse around to create a trail. click to change the color of the circle. drag to make it pulse "bubbles". </p>

				<h3> process: </h3><p> i decided to upload my coding onto OpenProcessing.org since i was having difficulties trying to screen capture it on my Compaq laptop. also, the particle effect seemed too complicated to convert it into a P5 code for me, so i wanted to use a platform that will allow me to keep the code as it is. going further in depth with Processing within the class, it was easy to follow the lessons until math got involved as i'm not much of a math person. as much as i hate to admit it, i ended up using other artists' codes to help create my own interactive P5 art. to make it my own, i changed the coloring, some of the code of the trail to keep its saturated colors, and some of the code of the bubbles to not have outlines as well as sort of let the circles pulse when it is dragged. i also changed the sizing of the circles. </p>
