				<h3> description: </h3><p> a halo? the inner mind? you decide. </p>
				<h3> process: </h3><p> shot with a canon rebel t6, 18-55mm, f/?, iso?, shutter speed: unlimited. drew with the flash of our phones in the dark, shone towards the camera. pretty fun experience to just play with light. did not edit. thought it looked fine as is considering the shadows and lights; draws focus to the subject. </p>
